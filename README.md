About
---------
This is a simple two-page demo for a generic personal blog website. This is the first project form the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree, build inline with the project ruberic availabe [here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2667/view).

How to deploy
----------------
This project can be forked and used as a blog with minimum set-up or editing required.

Design Language
------------------
This project uses a simple design language, aimed at achiving a simple code base, simple design process and most importantly a simple end product.

Wherever possible the interface should be minimalistic and easy on the eye. Simple colours or gradients combined with rounded colours and subtle interactions create a complete feeling interface without adding clutter, bloat or cognative load to the users experience.

The project uses Udacity's [HTML](https://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/index.html) and [CSS](https://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/css.html) style guides for clean code.

More on the design language can be found in [design-language.md](design-language.md).

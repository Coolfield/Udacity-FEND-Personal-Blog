Design Language
===============
Basic design themes and styles are outlined in the [Design Styles](/src/design.html) page.

The project uses 3 main colours:
- #e5e5db as a light colour for cards and body,
- #f8f8f8 as an off white for backgrounds,
- #ff2222 as a red accent colour,
- #000 for text.

Media queries are seperated into a seperate folder whilst regular custom
classes, navigation and card styles are in their own respective files to pevent
accidentally making a breaking style change to the core css for those to function
correctly.

Headings follow a natural regression in scale and weight from h1 to h6.

The three diamonds represent a divider inline with the theme of this project.

Both short and long para text is styled the same, where the longer text wraps after reaching the width of parent container.

Placeholder text uses the 'Bacon Ipsum' format (see readme.md).

Single images alone have 15px border radius and 100% width.

Use block quotes for quotes - block quotes are italicised and have a small font-size. Blockquotes are also offset from the left.

Grid images have 15px border radius and exist in threes.
